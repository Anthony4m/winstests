# Project Name: winstests

## Description
This project, "winstests," is a C++ application that demonstrates network communication using the Tnet library on Windows. It includes both client and server components to showcase basic network operations. This README provides information on how to build, run, and understand the project.

## Prerequisites
Before building and running this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- CMake (Version 3.26 or higher)
- A C++ compiler that supports C++17 (e.g., GCC, Clang, Visual C++)
- Windows Operating System (this project relies on the `ws2_32` library, which is specific to Windows)

## Building the Project
Follow these steps to build the "winstests" project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anthony4m/winstests.git
cd winstests
```

2. Create a build directory and navigate to it.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Use CMake to generate the project files based on the provided `CMakeLists.txt`.

```bash
cmake ..
```

4. Build the project using your preferred build tool (e.g., `make` on Unix-like systems or Visual Studio on Windows).

On Unix-like systems:

```bash
make
```

On Windows (using Visual Studio or another IDE generated by CMake):

Open the generated solution file and build the project.

## Running the Project
After successfully building the project, you can run the client and server components. Here's how:

### Running the Server
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the build directory (if you are not already there).

```bash
cd build
```

3. Run the server executable.

```bash
./server_exe
```

The server will start and listen for incoming connections.

### Running the Client
1. Open another terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the build directory (if you are not already there).

```bash
cd build
```

3. Run the client executable.

```bash
./client_exe
```

The client will connect to the server, and you should see the communication between the client and server in the respective terminal/command prompt windows.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `CMakeLists.txt`: The CMake configuration file for the project.
- `Tnet/`: A directory containing the Tnet library source code and header files.
- `client/`: The client source code.
- `server/`: The server source code.

## Dependencies
This project depends on the following components:

- `ws2_32`: The Windows Socket Library, used for socket communication on Windows.
- `Tnet`: A custom library provided in the project, which handles network communication.

## Additional Information
For further details about the Tnet library, please refer to the documentation provided in the `Tnet` directory.
